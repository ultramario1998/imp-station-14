  # Mixtures

  Making various doughs, cheese, and more is as simple as knowing what ingredients to mix in a container! No appliances required.

  Most recipes don't need very precise ratios, so if you mess up, just add more.
  
  Measurements here will be written in [color=cyan]units[/color]. One egg typically has 6 units inside it but may vary depending on the source.
