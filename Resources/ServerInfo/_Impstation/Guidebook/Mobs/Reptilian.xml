  Reptilians are universally adapted for warm climates, but are remarkably biodiverse - ranging from desert-adapted subspecies with heat-regulating radiative sails, to semi-aquatic subspecies complete with gills and fins.

  As all Reptilians possess prehensile tails, [color=#1e90ff]they are capable of dragging objects behind them without using their hands.[/color]

  ## Dietary Restrictions

  Reptilians are obligate carnivores, and as such are [color=#ffa500]only able to digest meat and fruit products.[/color] Their immune system has adapted to provide immunity to most food-borne illnesses, meaning [color=#1e90ff]they are able to eat raw meat and drink blood without suffering any ill effects.[/color] They are known to be [color=#ffa500]susceptible to poisoning from some plant-derived chemicals, such as theobromine and allicin.[/color]

  ## Damage

  [color=yellow][bold]NOTE:[/bold][/color] Species damage modifiers work largely the same way worn armor does, primarily applying to external, direct sources of damage. Unless explicitly stated, these [color=yellow][bold]do not[/bold][/color] apply to intrinsic sources of damage, such extreme pressure, extreme body temperature, or metabolizing chemicals.

  Due to their aptitude for warm climates, Reptilians have a [color=#1e90ff]high tolerance for warm temperatures.[/color] However due to their cold-blooded nature, they take [color=#ffa500]30% more Cold damage and have lower tolerance for cold temperatures.[/color]

  As they possess claws, [color=#1e90ff]their unarmed attacks do Slash damage instead of Blunt.[/color]

 ## Reptilian Naming Conventions
  Reptilian names traditionally take the form of a short hyphenated phrase in their native language, typically related to their professions or interests. Some Reptilians may choose to translate this name into Common.
