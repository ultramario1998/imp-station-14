 ## Heat Vent
  Anomalocarids are thermal vent dwellers, and to withstand the cold of the deep sea, their bodies developed a natural self heating ability through a mysterious chemical reaction. Outside of water this reaction can quickly spiral out of control, [color=#ffa500]requiring them to regularly vent their excess heat as water vapor.[/color]

 ## Damage
  Living near thermal vents has adapted Anomalocarids to the heat, giving them [color=#1e90ff]25% extra resistance to heat damage.[/color] Unfortunately, time spent out of the water has thinned their exoskeletons and made them more susceptible to cold temperatures, leaving them [color=#ffa500]25% more vulnerable to cold damage,[/color] and [color=#ffa500]15% more vulnerable to blunt and piercing damage. [/color]
  Despite the softening of their exoskeletons, they still provide [color=#1e90ff]15% extra resistance against slashing damage.[/color]
  Fortunately, their [color=#ffa500]strange origin[/color] has made them [color=#1e90ff]10% more resistant to poisons and radiation.[/color]
 
 ## Anomalocarid Naming Conventions
  Anomalocarid names are typically combinations of bubbling and clicking sounds, unpronouncable to most other species. To make things easier for their non-Anomalocarid friends, most Anomalocarids will add a nautical term to the start of their names.
  Rarely, some Anomalocarids may even combine the name of someone in their life they find important with their own birth name.
