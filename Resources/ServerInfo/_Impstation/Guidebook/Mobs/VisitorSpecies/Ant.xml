  Ants are a rare and reclusive species, and also the most diminuitive. They make up for their small size with their [color=#1e90ff]surprising strength[/color], allowing them to carry any item a larger species could.
  Unfortunately, ants are [color=#ffa500]extremely fragile[/color], rarely surviving after even the most minor injuries.
