  # Getting a bit of bang for your buck here because chefs will Kill Entire Monkeys just to get casings.
  # Compare raw meat, where a monkey gives you 3 steaks that can be turned into 9 cutlets.
  # I feel like 1 stomach -> 4 casings is fair.

# This prototype exists for the ChefVend, basically pre-prepared casing minus organ functionality.
# This is because I don't want to put 8 individual casings into the vendor / add a new box prototype for it.
# Much easier to just add two of these to the vend.
