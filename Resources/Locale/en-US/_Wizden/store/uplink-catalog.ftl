uplink-hypereutactic-blade-name = Hypereutactic Blade
uplink-hypereutactic-blade-desc = A gigantic energy sword with power that matches its looks. Requires two hands. Slow and unwieldy, yet pretty adept at reflecting. Previously made infamous by an operative wearing a joy mask. You wouldn't want to see this coming at you down the hall!
