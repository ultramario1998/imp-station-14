book-text-tamlin = In the early days of space exploration, cosmic rays were recorded by cosmonauts aboard the Apollo 11. These rays, which posed no threat planetside, being absorbed by the atmosphere, bombarded electronics and human spacefarers with radiation from a seemingly unknown source. Cameras and computing equipment was damaged, often permanently, from these periodic flashes.

        Investigation using rudimentary human technology on the 16th Apollo mission determined that cosmic rays would pass through the retina and trigger a response from the rod and cone cells within the eye, creating an illusion of a colourless or blue 'spot' (from a perpendicular ray), a 'streak' (a ray at an angle) or a 'spark' (a ray with branches, or clouds). These visions were recorded even when cosmonauts had their eyes closed or were blindfolded, at a rate of one per 2.9 minutes on average.

        In modern times, all Nanotrasen stations and vessels are fitted with radiation-absorbing nanoparticles, as an element of the steel alloy which is ubiquitous throughout the hundreds of active sectors. Radiation is no longer a threat, but an energy source which can be harnessed and used to further Nanotrasen's prime directive.

        Yet, the universe continues to expand as new discoveries are made in the field.

        On board the recent Urunjeri 6 mission, cosmonauts reported cosmic rays that were seemingly able to pierce the radiation shielding of their vessel. These rays appeared first as typical visions under the eyelids, which gradually resolved into the appearance of a biped. A human cosmonaut gave this apparition the moniker of 'Tam Lin'- a nod to the original term for cosmic rays used by cosmonauts on board the Apollo, and their own Terran ancestry.

        Even after the Urunjeri left the perimeter of the radiation hotspot, the apparition remained, although onboard geiger counters showed that it had ceased emitting radiation itself. Xenobiologists stationed on the vessel were able to secure the apparition within a spare artifact container, and in doing so, discovered that it had manifested a physical form, and could communicate simple telepathic ideas.

        There have long been reports of inanimate or otherwise benign objects gaining sentience and self-awareness through continued exposure to unknown extraterrestrial stimuli, and Nanotrasen's science division is still hard at work uncovering more information about this phenomenon. However, these 'Tam Lins', with their distinct similarities to the long-conquered cosmic rays of yore, indicate that the universe is evolving, mutating, alongside us.

        As we stare into the void of space, what else might yet stare back?
