login-tips-dataset-26 = The science behind THC + alcohol as a combination is literally soo interesting because it basically causes the crimson red duckling in your body to confront the serpent in the bronze vessel of your heart.

You can have bad highs when this happens if the duckling awakens the serpent and it bites the duckling. The interesting part is when you ingest alcohol after THC because it floods the vessel and causes the serpent to fall into a deep sleep. The duckling never gets attacked by the serpent when this happens because it is unconscious and the duckling is actually able to get fat from the harmonious seed, which causes an enjoyable sensation.

    The fallen leaves tell a story.

    The great Elden Ring was shattered.

    In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.

    Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,

    and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish.

    Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.

    The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.

    A war from which no lord arose.

    A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.

    Arise now, ye Tarnished.

    Ye dead, who yet live.

    The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.

    Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands.

    The ever-brilliant Goldmask.

    Fia, the Deathbed Companion.

    The loathsome Dung Eater.

    And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.

    And one other. Whom grace would again bless.

    A Tarnished of no renown.

    Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.

    To stand before the Elden Ring.

    And become the Elden Lord.

Bang. And they're fuckin' done. I used four shots just to make damn sure because, once again, I'm not there to coddle a bunch of criminal scum sucking-----. I'm there to: 1) survive the fuckin' round. 2) Guard the armory. So you can absolutely get fucked. If I get unbanned, which I won't, you can guarantee I will continue to use the shotgun to apprehend criminals because it's quick, clean, and effective as fuck. Why in the seven hells would I fuck around with the disabler shots--which takes half the clip just to bring someone down--or with the taser bolts, which are slow as balls, impossible to aim, and do about next to jack shit. Above all, the shotgun is the superior law enforcement weapon because it stops crime. And it stops crime by reducing the number of criminals roaming the fuckin' halls.

    I am a professional Cottage Cheese Consumer! While I was at Aldi‚Äôs today I picked up some Cottage Cheese! It was Aldi‚Äôs Friendly Farm! I have never tried this brand. I grew up eating another brand. One of my favorite way to eat Cottage Cheese is with chunky salsa

    I came home and eagerly, excitedly opened the container and when I put the fork to my mouth I couldn‚Äôt help but smile! I am a professional Cottage Cheese Consumer and I know how Cottage Cheese should be. The way it should smells as I bring it closer to my lips. I know the way it should feel when it touches my tongue. And I know the way it should taste! Cottage Cheese should be Cold, Soothing, Comforting, Salty, Soft, Creamy. It surpassed my expectations!!! Friendly Farm Cottage Cheese was Cold, Soothing, Comforting, Salty, Soft, and Creamy! Not like another brand has not been. I have been so disappointed with other. When you buy small curd you expect small curd. Every other carton of small curd that I have purchased from other brands ends up having clunky large curds in it. It is very disappointing. They are gross. I am a professional Cottage Cheese Consumer and I will only get Aldi‚Äôs Cottage Cheese from now on. ‚Äî Ôøºfeeling blessed.
