                    Thank you for your purchase of your 'Mini-Mecha' Mystery Figurine Kit!

                    All you have to do to put your ‘Mecha’ together is 3 simple steps:
                    - Cut the parts out of the sprues with your favourite wire or sprue cutters.
                    - Clean off excess plastic from the parts with a sharp blade.
                    - Assemble the parts into the complete figure with tweezers (or a wrench, if tweezers are not available)

                    CAUTION: Please be careful when using any sharp tools on the small parts contained in this kit.
