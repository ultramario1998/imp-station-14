                    - All players must agree on an amount of cards to play, so all players have the same card count in their deck.
                    - Each player draws one card from their deck.
                    - One person begins by reading out a category such as Whimsy from their card, each card has a number rating of 1-10 for each category.
                    - Then the person with the highest number rating in the chosen category wins the other players cards, adding them to the bottom of their deck.
                    - If there is a draw that rounds cards are placed aside and given to the next player to win a turn.
                    - The winner of the last round chooses the next category.
                    - This continues until one of the players has everyone's cards, which they then can keep!
