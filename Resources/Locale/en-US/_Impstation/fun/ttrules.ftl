                    - One person begins by reading out the name of a card from their hand and a category such as Whimsy, but does Not reveal their cards number.
                    - Each players cards have a number rating of 1-10 on each category, the other players will put forward a card from their hand based on the category chosen.
                    - Then the person with the highest number rating in the chosen category wins the other players cards, adding them to their hand.
                    - If there is a draw that rounds cards are placed aside and given to the next player to win a turn.
